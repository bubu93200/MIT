These instructions are for building MuseScore with VS2022. Any edition of this version of Visual Studio should work, including the Community edition, which is full-featured and free to use for open-source projects.

Whether or not you already have Visual Studio installed, please read these instructions carefully, as you might need to install some additional components.

    If you do not already have VS2022 installed, download Visual Studio Community https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community
1. Use Visual Studio installer  
When you run the Visual Studio installer (either for the first time, or after installing, to change options), you will get eventually to the Workloads tab. Make sure the Desktop development with C++ option is selected.!
